\section*{Code of Academic Integrity}

\footnotesize
Since the college is an academic community, its fundamental purpose is the pursuit of knowledge. Essential to the success of this educational mission is a commitment to the principles of academic integrity. Every member of the college community is responsible for upholding the highest standards of honesty at all times. Students, as members of the community, are also responsible for adhering to the principles and spirit of the following Code of Academic Integrity.

Activities that have the effect or intention of interfering with education, pursuit of knowledge, or fair evaluation of a student's performance are prohibited. Examples of such activities include but are not limited to the following definitions:

\paragraph{Cheating} Using or attempting to use unauthorized assistance, material, or study aids in examinations or other academic work or preventing, or attempting to prevent, another from using authorized assistance, material, or study aids. Example: using an unauthorized cheat sheet in a quiz or exam, altering a graded exam and resubmitting it for a better grade, etc.
\\

\noindent I acknowledge and agree to uphold this Code of Academic Integrity. \\

\section*{Instructions}

This exam is seventy five minutes and closed-book. You are allowed \textbf{one} page (front and back) of a \qu{cheat sheet.} You may use a graphing calculator of your choice. Please read the questions carefully. If the question reads \qu{compute,} this means the solution will be a number otherwise you can leave the answer in \textit{any} widely accepted mathematical notation which could be resolved to an exact or approximate number with the use of a computer. I advise you to skip problems marked \qu{[Extra Credit]} until you have finished the other questions on the exam, then loop back. I also advise you to use pencil. The exam is 100 points total plus extra credit. Partial credit will be granted for incomplete answers on most of the questions. \fbox{Box} in your final answers. NO FOOD but drinks okay. Good luck!

\problem Measuring the speed of light using a laser is known to be unbiased i.e. the mean is $\theta = 299792458$ m/s.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3in]{laser.png}
\end{figure}

\noindent However, there is variance $\sigsq$ which we seek to understand. We do 3 experiments and find measurements of the speed of light to be $x_1 = 303884490$, $x_2 = 296562208$ and $x_3 = 306150981$. Assume these measurements are $\iid \normnot{\theta}{\sigsq}$.

\problem Ladislaus Josephovich Bortkiewicz was a Polish economist and statistician who published a book in 1898 about the Poisson distribution. A famous dataset in this book is the \qu{Prussian horse-kicking data} famous. 


\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3in]{horse.png}
\end{figure}

\noindent The data gave the number of soldiers killed by being kicked by a horse each year in each of 16 different cavalry corps over a 20-year period. Bortkiewicz showed that those numbers followed a Poisson distribution and hence we can assume the following data for the general corps is $\iid \poisson{\theta}$.

\problem Every worker at the chocolate factory must wrap the chocolate desserts. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3in]{chocolate.png}
\end{figure}

\noindent Each dessert takes a variable amount of time to wrap. We can assume since wrapping has many factors summed, an $\iid \normnot{\theta}{\sigsq}$ is a good model where $\sigsq$ is known to be 0.01 seconds-squared. However, every worker has a different $\theta$. 

A new worker is hired and we naturally want to see how fast this worker wraps on average. For the first three wrappings, the worker does it in 0.23 seconds, 0.21 seconds and 0.24 seconds for an average of $\xbar = 0.2267$ seconds. This is remarkably fast relative to other workers so it is unrealistic to assume this is a good estimate of this new worker's true $\theta$. Here are other worker's lifetime averages:

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=5in]{hist.png}
\end{figure}

\noindent Fitting a normal distribution to this data and using maximum likelihood, we find the average worker lifetime wrapping time average is 0.930 seconds with a variance of 0.0000927 seconds-squared. We would like to use the empirical Bayes estimation to draw inference for the new worker's $\theta$.


\benum


\subquestionwithpoints{5} If we use the normal fit of other workers' lifetime averages to create a prior, this prior will be equivalent to how many pseudoobservations $n_0$? \spc{4}

\subquestionwithpoints{2} Is this prior uninformative? Yes / no. \spc{-0.5}

\subquestionwithpoints{5} Compute $\thetahathatmmae$ under this prior. \spc{5}

\subquestionwithpoints{5} Calculate the shrinkage $\rho$ for this $\thetahathatmmae$ estimate under this prior. \spc{4}

\subquestionwithpoints{8} Express the probability that this new worker is better than average under this prior using Table 1. \spc{3}

\problem Measuring the speed of light using a laser is known to be unbiased i.e. the mean is $\theta = 3.0 \times 10^8$ m/s. However, there is variance $\sigsq$ which we seek to understand.

\benum

\subquestionwithpoints{4} Find $\thetahatmle$. \spc{0}

%\subquestionwithpoints{4} What is the main problem with your estimate in (a)? \spc{2}

\subquestionwithpoints{5} Compute a $CI_{\theta, 95\%}$. The applicable $z_{\alpha/2} = 2$ for this confidence interval. \spc{2}

\subquestionwithpoints{5} Does the interval in (c) fulfill the second goal of statistical inference? Yes / no and explain your answer. \spc{6}


\subquestionwithpoints{5} We will now conduct Bayesian inference. Consider the reduced parameter space $\Theta_0 = \braces{1/3, 1/2, 2/3} \subset \Theta = (0, 1)$. We believe strongly in $\theta = 0.5$ but we want to give some credence to the alternate values. Thus we establish a prior of 

\beqn
\prob{\theta} = \begin{cases}
1/3 \withprob 0.1 \\ 
1/2 \withprob 0.8 \\ 
2/3 \withprob 0.1 \\ 
\end{cases}
\eeqn

Is this the \qu{prior of indifference} for the reduced parameter space? Yes / no. If yes, explain why. If no, what would the prior of indifference be?\spc{2}

\subquestionwithpoints{4} We will now consider the entire parameter space for the binomial model i.e. $\Theta = (0, 1)$. We will use the prior $\theta \sim \betanot{0}{0}$. We will see later in class that this is called \qu{Haldane's prior of ignorance}. Is this prior a legal rv? Circle one: yes / no.\spc{-0.5}

\subquestionwithpoints{4} Regardless of the answer to your previous question, how many pseudofailures is represented by this prior?\spc{0.5}


\subquestionwithpoints{4} We will use the prior $\theta \sim \betanot{0.1}{0.1}$. Is this prior a legal rv? Circle one: yes / no.\spc{-0.5}
